# Just Tech News

 This is a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. This manages objects using JavaScript and translates the code into database schema and queries using SQL.  I created this to demonstrate Object Relational Mapping through the Sequelize ORM library.  This currently has no live site since cancelling Heroku.  I will find a new host and redeploy the site.  The previously-deployed application was on Heroku [Here](https://hidden-atoll-42819.herokuapp.com/).
